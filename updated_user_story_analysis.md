I have completed the implementation of several user stories by modifying `apps/web/src/pages/profile.tsx` and updating the translation files (`apps/web/src/messages/en/index.json` and `apps/web/src/messages/es/index.json`), as well as `apps/web/src/pages/trips/[id].tsx`.

Here's an updated status of the user stories:

The following user story remains:

*   **P2: As a passenger, I want to search for available trips between two locations, so I can find a ride.** (Currently: Partially Implemented - backend functional, but UI not confirmed as advanced).

I am now finished with this set of implementations. What would you like to do next?
